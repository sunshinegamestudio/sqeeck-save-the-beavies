		<p>Sqeeck (squirrel) lands in a trunk on an unknown island (fantasy). The trunk flies with the wind/storm on the island.</p>
		<p>On the island he is found by the Beavies (some kind of monkey animal).</p>
		<p>Then the island is captured by other unknown animals (no name yet). Sqeeck must chase away the other unknown animals.</p>
		<p>Each level has a boss that must be beaten. The last boss is the king of the unknown animals. When this is done the game is finished.</p>
		<p>The game uses the game engine jMonkeyEngine (<a class="externallink" href="http://jmonkeyengine.org/" rel="nofollow" title="http://jmonkeyengine.org/">http://jmonkeyengine.org/</a>).</p>
