Sqeeck (squirrel) lands in a trunk on an unknown island (fantasy). The trunk flies with the wind/storm on the island.

On the island he is found by the Beavies (some kind of monkey animal).

Then the island is captured by other unknown animals (no name yet). Sqeeck must chase away the other unknown animals.

Each level has a boss that must be beaten. The last boss is the king of the unknown animals. When this is done the game is finished.

The game uses the game engine jMonkeyEngine (http://jmonkeyengine.org/).
